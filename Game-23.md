## Will humans destroy Earth?
In about 100 years we would have about total control of the Earth, but the dangerous part is where we are at now, there are so many possible threats that just eliminate people in mass. 

The internet is type1 communication system, english is a type1 language.

Terrorism is directly against a type1 civilisation. 

## What is string theory, what do we know?  what do you think?
String theory goes all the way down to quarks and says there is a tiny fillament of energy that can be "vibrated" to create the particle. convention says nothing is below quarks, but string theory says there are the strings of energy which vibrate differently to determine if those quarks are going be an electron or a proton or a neutron.  


## What is the Dark Matter?

Very crunchy toast that is used to explain why there is acceleration in space in places that do not make sense.

## Other reflections on what we discussed and what we saw?
Einstien was more or less unheard of in the USA's general public until the solar eclipse was successfully photographed. 

Cambell has come to a conclusion tenatively that Einstien's theory was incorrect, but he does not want to risk being wrong against the giant to immeditely annouce so, thus he goes back to re-analysing the results he has many times. 

Eddington was an absolute goon and had some 90% of his samples deemed worthless but the few that he has that can be used are kinda hard to use because the starlight that is visible is blurry. 

Cambell came out and said Einstien was wrong to the astromical society, but Eddington said lmao watch this. 

Eventually, many papers declared Einstien was incorrect.
