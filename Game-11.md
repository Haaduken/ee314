### What do you think about Inquiry Based Learning that we have discussed today? Have you seen it in other places?  Do you see the value?  Please reflect

I think that the inquiry based learning is something that is more logical than what often occurs in academic where we recieve lecture and then guidelines with a set standard to achieve, going outside and beyond it is usually not as well covered and getting clarity and better understanding fully falls on the student to go to the professor(s) to get it figured out. Even then some professors will tell you not to fully worry about it and just focus on the assignment. Other professors will get enthusiastic and try to give understanding for the subject, however it will usually be the end of it. 

This upcomming semester, it feels like there are a few classes that are trying to be a little more inquiry based with some open interpretation questions and encouraging student questions to progress the course, however it feels like it is still coming short of the overall idea of inquiry based learning. 

### What is the issue of duality of wave and particle?  Are Electons, showing waves or particle characteristics?  Explain 

A property of particles is that is can only be in one position at any point in time, this costrasts a property that waves have which is that a single wave can be in multiple positions at any given point in time. As shown in the video, the electron before being observed at the entire time was showing properties of being a wave, with it emitting on the paper with high and low areas on the paper. But at the same time, when they were closely observing the electron, watching it particle at one position and then it was acting as though it was a particle creating just 2 pillars of light instead of the wave chart instead.
