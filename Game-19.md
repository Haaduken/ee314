## Notes
Einstein began as a teenager dropout from school but a thought experiment is what led him to get to where he ended up.  

Light was acting as both a particle and a wave and people were struggling to understand how it could travel through space. This is where Aether is applied to the cosmos which is what allows light to move through space.  

Experiment to split light and make it end up at the same place, the results showed no difference in teh speed of light regardless of the orientation. "Greatest Failed Experiment".

The relative speed of somebody walking on a train in respect to somebody off the train, their speed would be the train's speed + walking speed.  

Einstein knew the ability to observe "still" waves of light was impossible since it had incredible speeds.  

### Postulate 1  
    Laws of physics is same for all interial reference frames

### Postulate 2  
    The speed of light in a vaccuum is constant for all reference frames  

The person travelling on the train must be expereicing time differently. He has concluded that time is relative and varies in different frames of reference, there is no absolute time thereby no longer needing the concept of ether.  

Conservation of mass vs conservation of rest mass are different. All masses, even at rest, have energy.  

Einstein rejected others' claims of Ether and came to the conlcusion of E=MC^2

### Total Solar Eclipse 
During a total solar eclipse, light should warp around the sun and go around it, and it can be observed during such an event.  

He then gets into contact with a US Community on the mountains that had a huge telescope and some galaxy brain Campbell guy who did a bunch of eclipse anaylsis. 

They are trying to get information to either prove or disprove Einstein's new theory for the eclipse in 1914.  

He tells his wife that if she divorces him, he would give her the nobel prize money.  

Because Germany declared war, the goons going to go take pics of the eclipse, but the german guy got deemed as a prisoner of war.  All of this happened, they finally got there, and its a cloudy day so it was deemed a failure.  

## Reflection
Overall, I think its hilarious that they went through all the struggle to go get this eclipse pic, getting arresting and taken as a POW in Russia, only for it to be a cloudly day and the eclipse and the photos got ruined.
