## [Article on Maxwell](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Maxwell/)

To begin with, I was very impressed that at the young age of 14 he was fully able to understand ellipses and go into the theoredics of it, meanwhile the earliest introduction to base geometry with equations for such that I encountered was in 8th or 9th grade, and that was just a surface level of understanding, I was not going to be creating any new or revolutionary breakthroughs with my understandings. He would be described as somebody who was aloof during his junior high years, and understandable so as his classmates were left in the dust when comparing his understanding to the material in comparison to theirs, and this was only previewd by them later in highschool when he was winning awards and scholarships left and right. This, along with the fact that he had 3 papers that were breaking grounds by the age of 16, blows my mind, thinking at what I have done so far seems so insignifigant in comparison.

He had many other contributions to the world of science as he progressed in his life, with the article emphasizing on his extensions on Faraday's theories over electricity and magetisim. He was able to link concepts together with such a level of expertise and understanding that it was almost scary and even got Stokes to write to him, acknowledging that he had advanced his theorems. He would later research Saturn and its rings with the topic being set in 1847 for the Adams Prize of 1857. With researcher showing incredible results, within 10 years he furthered the understanding of the planet and it's rings immensely. His main arguement was to show that stability in the rings could only occur if the rings were thousands of small particles and not one solid uniform ring, something that would later be proven by the Voyager telescope. The fact that he discovered this and had a solid theory and evidence to back it up without the technologies we have today to figure it out is incredible and once again shows just how well he understood the subject at hand and how to go about it. INCREDIBLE!

I think that the most incredible part of what he has done was working with the speed of light. In 1862 just 5 years after completeing work on Saturn's rings, did he calculate the speed of waves in an electromagnetic field and corrolate it to the speed of light. This single part is critical for engineers today as it applies to how light waves work fundamentally and would further all understanding of the electromagnetic. However to a bit more directly answer what would be the most important, "Maxwells Equations" would be, however that feels kinda cheat-y to say as that is a core concept of E&M.

I think Maxwell as a person is incredibly interesting, he was able to master and understand such complex topics that had many of the brightest minds of the time working on, but would come out on top with understanding and though-ness. He had such an indepth understanding of Space, E&M, Theoredical and Practical Maths, and even Chemistry with the Kinetic Theory of Gas. If I could understand just one of these to the level he did, I would feel acomplished, but he did way more than just these few things, winning awards, gaining prestidge, and even appointed hihgh level chairs at Colleges and Universities. I think Maxwell was truly someone who advanced humanity's understanding of the world signifigantly, and I can only imagine how much further he could go with today's technology in hand.
