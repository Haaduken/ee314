1. Research and find what SI Units are
   1. What is the SI Unit, provide a brief History and information of what it is
      1. The basis of SI rests on the 7 constant values of 
         1. c:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Speed of light in a vacuum
         2. h:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Planck Constant
         3. e:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elementary charge
         4. Î”V:&nbsp;Transition frequency of cesium-133
         5. l:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boltzmann Constant
         6. N:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Avogadro Constant
         7. K:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luminous efficacy
      2. The system (otherwise known as metric) was signed as the international standard for measurement on May 20th, 1875 by several countries including the US. The 7 base units (metres, seconds, mole, amphere, kelvin, candela, and kilogram) define 22 other units that can be derived from them.
   <br><br>
   2. How are they defined for each case?
      1. carefully
   <br><br>
   1. What are the units of the following
      1. Electric Charge: Q
         * Columb -> Ampheres per Second 
      2. Electric Field Intensity:  E
         *  Volts per Metre
      3. Electric Flux Density:     D
         *  Volt Metres
      4. Magnetic Field Intensity:  H
         *  Amphere per Metre
      5. Magnetic Flux Density:     B
         *  Kilograms/(Seconds^2 * Amphere)
      6. Electric Potential:        V
         *  Kilograms * Metres^2 / (Seconds^3 * Amphere)
      7. Electric Current:          I
         * Amphere
  
    <br>
2. Use Lorentz force equation and identify how the units for E 
and B are related to Newton (the SI unit of force.) 
    <br><br>
3. We know that wavelength in meters x frequency in Hz equals speed in m/s
   1. Show this with unit analysis
   2. Find the wavelengths for red and blue in the visible spectrum, which one has the shorter wavelength
   3. what about the lower frequencies? Which one has more energy?
   4. Repeat this for infrared and ultraviolet
   <br><br>
4. Research to find out and learn what an electromagnetic bomb is. Does it exist? What is it? How does it work? Reflect.<br>  
   According to [Air University](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/ASPJ/journals/Chronicles/apjemp.pdf), an eletromagnetic bomb, or an E-Bomb, creates an electromagnetic shockwave over a very large area with the objective of disabling or inhibiting electronics. It works by sending out short but frequent electromagnetic pulses. As [How Stuff Works](https://science.howstuffworks.com/e-bomb.htm) explains it, the device is less of a bomb and more of a massive microwave that acts more as a beam than a bomb, however they explore the idea of a more bomb-like version:
   > Using an armature surronded by a coil of wire, filled with explosives, and surronded by a sturdy shell along with many capacitors, a bomb version could be created
   
   This could easily be launched, dropped, or remotely detonated and construction is fairly rudamentary which is a scary thought
   <br><br>
5. Read chapter 1 of the book.
   1. Summary
   2. List Major Definitions
   3. What did you learn and find interesting?
