The belief that Ether is a solid medium rather than a liquid. A majority of the paper, Einstein is trying to logic through what exactly Ether is. He applies the knowledge and theories he has of light, electro magnetic fields, space-time, and others to try to logic out a conclusion of what it could be along with any properties it might have. Einstein covers the history of ether as well, trying to set up a basis to build off of. He uses the work of Hertz, Lorentz, Newton, and of course, Maxwell to build this theory and try to justify it.    
Einstein points out that the ether hypothosis has nothing behind it initially, but using maxwell's equations in a vacuo process, he concludes its the only thing that can properly interact with ether, and is also not effected by physical modifications/diversity. I think the pathways he is establishing are valid, but it goes pretty far over my head on what he is trying to say. I appreciate his mindset of "If this works, everything makes sense and physics is complete", as it would cause there to be no more loose ends in how science could go about solving a problem, all the answers would be there, just had to be worked towards since everything was linked in some forme or another. 

This reading was very tough for me to go through, I cannot tell if it was because I was tired xor it was just way beyond me. I had to re-read the content multiple times just to process what the words were saying, let alone attempt to understand them. I think the theory was more of a philosophical one than a mathmatical one as it was trying to logic out what exactly Ether is. In addition to this, I think the whole K coordinate system was very interesting, but complex. I think, if nothing else, this paper shows how far we have come in linking different parts of physics together as the world has devleoped more and more and the general understanding has grown exponentially.
