# General Notes
Flame has positive and negative ions within and can be observed with putting it within a strong electric field  
Additionally the smoke from after the fire is extinguished behaves similiarly  

Faraday is the one who found out about eddy currents, which is why the magnet slows down when if falls through the copper tube  

Faraday was able to observe that a magnetic field was able to create a current, and that it was not a one-way relationship  

## Einstein Video
Froinlick was arrested as a POW, the oberservation was a failure because it was cloudy. Einstein feels responsible for the failure and the arrests. Next his friend began working on a chemical weapon to kill people faster, and Einstein was truly appaled by this , and as the war continued, he lost more and more faith in the people he worked with. He writes a manifesto to argue against war, but is rejected for it and isolated.  
He was reflecting back on the bending of the light around the sun, but he realised a flaw with his original equation and went from there. He would listen to classical music as he worked towards a solution.  
After finding his errors, he was making a tonne of progress on his research, but he was not done figuring everything out yet.  
As he was racing against some Math Nerd named Hilbert to the solution of relativity, he realised that an old solution that he deemed irrational at the time was actually what he needed to use to progress forward.  
In 1915 he was able to come to the final theory and equation on the general theory of relativity.  

## Overall
I think the risks that Einstein was taking requires an insane level of drive and willpower. Even when he was in the dumps and was going through the betrayal of friends, and the divorce of his wife, the seperation of his family, but was able to prevail through it all by himself.
