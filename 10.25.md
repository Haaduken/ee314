Electrons in a shell must be spin up or spin down  
There will be an equal number of spin up and spin down, it cannot be more or less unless at an odd number  

### Fermions
Half spins (1/2, 3/2, 5/2)  
Quarks, n shit, Electrons  
Obey [thing] Principal  

### Bonsons
Full spins 2, 1, 0  
Photons, Gluons, Gravitons  

### Entanglement
When two particles interact, their waves effect each other, and will have properties that are dependent on each other.  
Because the electrons are entangled, when their spin gets modified, it changes the other electron's spin to be the opposite respectively.    

If it is continious, it is analog, if it is granular, it is digital.  

### Quantium Teleportation, Cryptography, and Computing exists

## Einstien's Papers
Galleleo used waves and how the Earth moving was the cause of them.  
Its based on the location of the moon as it pulls the waves to their apex causing high tide  

Book called sea walkers or night walkers
