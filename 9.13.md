## Demo Observations
### Pipe Dream?
With the aligator clip wires coiled around the copper tube when the magnet falls through resulted in nothing on the multimeter  

### Funky Machine with Light Switch
Electronic hum with the wires in the magnetic field and the hum can be adjusted via changing the frequency  
Adding a second spool of wire that is thinner results in a much quieter hum  
When the spools are connected, the secondary wire on the spool gets launched upward away from the primary wire  
With the multimeter plugged into the secondary wire, it jumps to about 2 volts  
With an aluminium ring above the primary wire and nothing else, it gets launched when the device gets toggled on  
When the current changes in the wire causes a change in the magnetic flux which causes the ring to feel a force to push it up  

<br>

I think the ring flies off due to the force exerted onto it from the magnetic field change. It feels the push with a greater magnitude than the secondary coil of wire since it is a singlular "sheet" in comparison to the coil of wire which has some level of seperation between each layer which dampens the force exerted. When taking the equation F = qE â€¢ qv x B in mind, the force is going in the upward direction meaning the field is pointing inward. ![ picture1](diagram.jpg) In my sketch, I (attempted) to show how the Lorentz equation relates to the base schematic. I am curious to know what would occur if the 2 spools of wire were attached at a different point like such ![ picture](./possibleConnection.jpg) So if plugged into point A vs point B how would it react. My prediction would be that one would push away (like how we saw in class) and the other might either  
<br>
A) Pull itself into the first wire (probably not noticibly) 

or

B) Act like the first wire and not "move" or react  

<br>

Both seem viable to occur as the force would now be in the downward direction, but it could just treat it as a continuation of itself and act as "normal"

## Who Killed Your Soul?
I feel that part of the issue was in highschool with many teachers forcing the same content day in and day out and the homeworks and exams just being regurgitations, not requiring any critical thinking, it was just black and white. The problem continued into a good number of my freshman and sophmore year classes that followed the same principals, except for calc 1-3 and physics. The education system feels flawed in the sense that it does not matter if you think out side of the box, if you do not follow the steps that they set up and layed out, you would fail system regardless. This system punishes those who go outside the box since the entire course is build around staying in the box perfectly.

## Other Notes
Always answer this question: What the hell happened to you? Who killed your soul?  
Electrons moving along the wire at half the speed of light as they only go down part of the way  
The electrons were "bumping" into each other but will never collide because they are repelling each other  
Moving it is adding some electrons to one end of the wire and removing some from the other end  
Current is charge per second
