Hyung-Woo Lee, Ki-Chan Kim and Ju Lee, "Review of maglev train technologies," in IEEE Transactions on Magnetics, vol. 42, no. 7, pp. 1917-1925, July 2006, doi: 10.1109/TMAG.2006.875842.  

#### Notes
- Maglev means Magnetic Levitation
- Pros
  - Environment friendly
  - Low Maintenance
  - Environment friendly
  - Suited for mass-transport
- Cons
  - The motors must be able to propel the train, but also have a way to brake the train as well
  - More weight = more electricity needed to keep it levitating
    - Not sustainable for freight
  - A magnetic field is generated from the electromagnets would reach passengers, some way to block these would be needed.
- Patented by Hermann Kemper from Germany in 1934
- Development continued in the 1960s to 1980s
- Prototypes and tests occured in the 1990s with the first one in 2003 in Shanghai China
- Removal of wheels removes the risk of derailment and dampens the noise/vibration pollution in the area

#### Notes
- Runs at 500 km /h
- Uses a Linear Synchronous Motor (LSM) that consists of a superconducting magnet on the train and an [armature coil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armature_(electrical)) in the ground
