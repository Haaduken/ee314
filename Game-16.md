## What can you say about Quantum entanglement?

Quantum Entanglement is very confusing and works in ways I do not fully understand, however it makes it so particles such as electrons become entangled/co-dependent upon one another making it so when one changes, the entangled one will also see a change. The main example that stuck out to me that was covered was how if the spin of one was changed, it would modify the other one's spin as to not match it, however there are also other attributes that are co-dependent.  
 

## What else in today's discussion interests you, talk about it.

Something that I didn't know was a thing until today is Quantum Teleportation, the ability to send quantum information to a different location, near instantly due to particles being entangled but not in the same area. This method has been labeled as instantanious, which would mean it is faster than light. I don't understand it properly, so I have been reading [this article](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature.2017.22321) to try to understand it better.
